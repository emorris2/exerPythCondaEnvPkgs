Python Assignment
[ ] Describe the Conda concepts used in the video and listed in the table below.

|   Concept   |         Description or short answer         |
|     ---     |                     ---                     |
|What is the purpose of having different environments?     |(To manage different packages that are needed for different projects.)|
|What is the default package manager in Python?            |(Pip)|
|How do you manage environments and packages in Anaconda?  |(Install Conda on computer and use it.)|
|`conda list`       |(List shows default packages installed on computer)|
|`conda env list`       |(List of default environments installed.)|
|How do you keep your base environment unchanged?       |(Make a separate new environment different from base.)|
|What is the link to the Conda cheat sheet? (link in video notes is broken)      |(https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/cheatsheet.html)|
|`conda create --name XXXX`       |(conda create --name ai383 python=3.8.3 created new environment to work in.)|
|`source activate XXXX`       |(Conda activate ai383 run It, it shows you are working in new environment)|
|`conda install YYYY`       |(Conda install Numpy installed numpy in da35 soenvironment)|
|channels in Conda       |(describes path where conda looks for packages available.)|
|`conda install -c ZZZZ YYYY`       |(Use channel one time to get package)|
|`conda config --show channels`       |(default channel-path conda uses when conda install runs to find packages)|
|`conda config --add channels ZZZZ`       |(able to add to channel and keep on channel list)|
|conda-forge.org       |(different channel for python but community led)|
|`source deactivate`       |(takes you to base channel.)|
|`conda config --get channels`       |(Shows channels in low to high priority where conda will look.)|

* After creating the environments he created in the video on your computer, what would the results of running the command `conda env list` look like with the da35 environment activated. Paste the output from your command prompt in the code block below.

```
#Paste your results here.

(da35) C:\Users\emaem>conda env list
# conda environments:
#
base				C:\Users\emaem\anaconda3
ai383				C:\Users\emaem\anaconda3\envs\ai383
da35			    * C:\Useers\emaem\anaconda3\envs\da35



```
* What command would you use to remove the environments you created for this exercise from your computer?

```
#Type the command here.

Conda env remove â€“-name bio-env
